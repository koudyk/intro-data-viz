# Introduction to Data Visualization

Welcome! Data visualization is an essential skill for scientists.

At the grad student level, you're probably already familiar with basic plots
(e.g., bar plot vs pie chart),
as well as types of data (e.g, ordered vs categorical).

With that in mind, I hope to take you a bit deeper into the technicalities of planning
and executing and effictive figures.
